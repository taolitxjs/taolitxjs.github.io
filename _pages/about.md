I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Applied and Creative Computing at Purdue University. I received a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from Arizona State University in 2020, a M.S. in Computer Science & Technology from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2015, and a B.E. in Software Engineering from Hangzhou Dianzi University in 2012. My primary research is on security and privacy issues in networked/mobile/distributed systems, AI and machine learning, indoor localization/navigation systems, wireless networks, mobile crowdsourcing, and mobile systems for disabled people.


<!-- I am currently seeking highly self-motivated Ph.D. or Master's students to join my research projects in the fields of security, machine learning, and mobile sensing. If students have prior experience in deep learning or signal processing, it would be a significant advantage. Interested students are encouraged to send their CVs and transcripts to tli6@iupui.edu.*-->
